## **_Image Classification_**
In this we will classify Images Cats and Dogs by building a **Convolutional Neural Network** in Python and by using **Transfer Learning** in Matlab.

## Buliding a Convolutional Neural Network
Run the code in Python folder preferably in Google Colaboratory.

## Using Transfer Learning
**Step-1:** Download the datset of Cats and Dogs from the link "https://storage.googleapis.com/mledu-datasets/cats_and_dogs_filtered.zip".

**Step-2** Unzip it into a folder and rename as Images.

**Step-3** In the same folder download the code in Matlab folder from Github.

**Step-4** In Images folder delete "ectorise.py" which is of no use and merge the files of cats and dogs in 2 seperate subfolders. So,now your Images folder contain a Subfolders Cats and Dogs.

**Step-5** Open Matlab, change folder and in the left side Right-Click the Images Folder and click Add to Path,Folders and Subfolders.

**Step-6** Run the Matlab code which uses Alexnet, after a few minutes of training, it shows the stats of accuracy, layers, etc. Give an input image for testing as a cat and dog and predict the results :smiley:
